Right, C# does not work with Multicharts. Probably it will work with Multicharts.net, but I am not sure about this,
Using Visual Studio 2017 with a C++ compiler and C-syntax the following code works.

__declspec(dllexport) double __cdecl Add(double x, double y)
   {
      double erg = 0.0;
      erg = x + y;
      return (erg);
   }

   __declspec(dllexport) double __cdecl Subtract(double x, double y)
   {
      return (x - y);
   }

}

in PLE:
CODE: SELECT ALL

DefineDLLFunc: "Dll1.dll", double, "Add", double, double;

It can be another language other than c++. It depends if the dll is managed or unmanaged. For C# you would need a wrapper.
